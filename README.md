Playing around with TABC tax data.

This data comes from http://www.window.state.tx.us/taxinfo/taxfiles.html

The _small sample files are just taxes from June 2014, for bars that say they are in Houston, downloaded around July 2014.

The _min file is what the js references, and that's tax data from Dec 2014, downloaded January 25 2015.

A bunch more data is in tax.csv, that's about a year's worth of time series data.  The bar index for that is in bars.csv.

"The Comptroller of Public Accounts cannot vouch for the data or analysis derived from data after it has been retrieved from the Comptroller's Web site."
